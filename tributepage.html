The Jackson 5, with 10-year-old Michael as lead singer, signs with Motown Records. In 1970, their first album is released, "Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5." It includes the hit singles "I Want You Back" and "I'll Be There," which go to No. 1.</li>
         <li><strong>1972</strong> - While still singing with the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson puts out his first solo album, "Got to Be There." It spawns his first No. 1 hit, "Ben."</li>

Jackson releases "Thriller," which becomes the world's best-selling album of all time and earns the singer eight Grammy awards. Seven of the album's nine songs hit No. 1. The music videos for "Billie Jean," "Beat It" and "Thriller" are elaborate productions that revolutionize the genre, and their popularity paves the way for other black artists, who had largely been shunned by the fledgling MTV.</li>
         <li><strong>1983</strong> - Jackson electrifies the 50 million viewers of the "Motown 25" television special by singing and dancing to "Billie Jean" while wearing a black fedora, one white glove, and pants that end above his ankles.</li>

During production of a Pepsi-Cola commercial, Jackson's scalp sustains burns when an explosion sets his hair on fire.</li>
         <li><strong>1985</strong> - Jackson and Lionel Richie write what becomes one of the fastest-selling singles ever with "We Are the World." The song was produced to raise money for victims of the Ethiopian famine. Jackson also pays $47.5 million for the rights to more than 250 songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.</li>
         <li><strong>1987</strong> - His album "Bad" produces five No. 1 singles and sells at least 22 million copies worldwide.</li>
         <li><strong>1993</strong> - Jackson reveals in a TV interview that he had an inherited disorder that caused his skin pigmentation to fade.

         <li><strong>2005</strong> - A judge clears Jackson of charges he molested a 13-year-old cancer survivor at Neverland in 2003. He had been accused of plying the boy with alcohol and groping him, and of engaging in strange and inappropriate behavior with other children.
